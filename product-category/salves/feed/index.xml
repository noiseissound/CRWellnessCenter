Discover the Amazing Benefits of this Natural Soap Infused with Hemp Oil and Hemp Terpenes

Hemp Oil is one of the worldâ€™s richest sources of polyunsaturated fats while also including two of the important essential fatty acids Omega 3 and Omega 6, and gamma-linolenic acid. These fatty acids are essential in helping maintain the natural moisture content in the body, and because of this, it acts as a good moisturizing agent for the skin. Hemp not only prevents the drying out of the skin, but it is also a rich source of Vitamin D and one begins to wonder why so little focus is provided to this wonderful option in skin care!H Hemp Oil is both moisturizing and penetrating, which helps increase its value when one is looking to add it to whole body care.

These benefits arise from the simple recognition that hemp contains three times more Omega-3 fatty acids than it does of the Omega-6. This is such an important point since Omega-3s are recognized for the anti-inflammatory benefits offered. By applying this to the skin in the form of soap, the fatty acids work to ease the inflammation caused by acne and even slow down the oxidation of free radicals, which in turn help the skin appear more healthy and youthful.

UNDERSTANDING HOW HEMP SOAPS REDUCES THE SIGNS OF AGING

One of the things many fail to realize is that as we age, the metabolism of our cells decrease and as a result, there is a reduction of essential fatty acids which are ingested that will be released into the epidermis (or the topmost layer of the skin). As a result, our skin becomes thinner and extremely dry. This age-related decline attributes to the formation of wrinkles and even the overall appearance of aged skin. The application of hemp oil through body care products, such as soaps and lotions, will compensate for the decline and minimize the signs of aging.
