		<description><![CDATA[Death Star is a cross between Sensi Star and Sour Diesel which is most commonly known as an indica dominant. Death Star possesses the best attributes of both its parents. It has the indica/sativa ratio of 75% to 25%. The strain bud, when crushed with fingers, proves to be extremely sticky, which is a sign of good quality when testing out different varieties of strains. There may be purple shades of colour visible in this particular strain's stems. Death Star gives out a combination of aromas including that of lemon and rubber, and taste of an eccentric sweetness. Overall, the strain is frosty looking one with broadly growing leaves. The aroma of this strain might be a bit pungent for a patient likes, since it has a mixed essence of both its parents. This medical marijuana strain has highly positive and calming effects for the patient and is also good for overcoming nausea and insomnia induced symptoms. It is potent and has high levels of CBD and THC.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pink Death Star is a flavorful creation by Riot Seeds. Known for its “spice rack” terpene profile, this strain reeks of cardamom, fennel, ginger, and pepper. This collection of flavors and the strain’s naturally high THC percentage make it a worthwhile addition to any strain collection. Pink Death Star delivers buds with deep purple hues and body-melting sedation, so naturally, this strain is best utilized in the evening.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Platinum Kush is an indica-dominant strain that takes on a platinum-silver shade due to its thick coat of crystal resin. With purple hues and bright orange hairs, its buds grow dense with a sweet fruity and hashy aroma. Its THC content can measure up to about 18% with trace levels of CBD, and its buzz has been described as strongly cerebral and body-numbing.]]></description>
